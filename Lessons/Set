# Set
## Intro
### What is a Set?
Sets are a built-in data type in Python that are used to store multiple items, or collections of data, as a single variable. The difference between sets and lists is that items in sets are unchangeable, but they can be removed or new items added, whereas items in lists can be changed. Also, where items contained in lists are ordered items in sets are not. Because sets are unordered they cannot contain duplicate items.
### Real-world uses for Set
A real-world example that comes to mind is a trading card collection. When opening packs of cards you want to add new cards to your collection, but want to avoid duplicate cards. Sets could be used to keep track of your collection so that you don’t have to continually look through your collection to see if a new card you pulled has already been added to your collection.
 
### Limitations of Sets
As mentioned above sets are unordered and cannot contain duplicates, resulting in a collection of unique items. If you are wanting to collect data with duplicate items you cannot use sets and must use another data structure. Likewise, if your data must be ordered you will not be able to use sets and must use another data structure.

## Example
The following is an example of a set (notice how sets are written with the items enclosed in curly brackets):
```python
exampleSet = {“item 1”, “item 2”, “item 3”}
print(exampleSet)
```
Another way of creating a set is as follows:
```python
exampleSet2 = set((“item 1”, “item 2”, “item 3”))
print(exampleSet2)
```
### Card Collection
Create a card collection using a set as a data structure:
```python

```
Get the length of your set (count of unique items in the set):
```python

```
Make sure the data structure you created is recognized as a set:
```python

```
Add cards to your collection:
```python

```
Display your card collection:
```python

```
Remove cards from your collection:
```python

```
Display your new collection:
```python

```

## Practice
### Create your own set (make sure to test your work).

```python
# Task 1 Create a set
```
```python
# Task 2 Ensure that the data structure you made is a set
```
```python
# Task 3 Add items to your set
```
```python
# Task 4 Remove items from your set
```
```python
# Task 5 Check the length of your set
```
```python
# Task 6 Add any other tests you feel are necessary
```
